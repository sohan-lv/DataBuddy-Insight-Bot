      <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        The dataset used by DataBuddy includes information about purchase orders, vendor details, item costs, catalog prices, and estimated profitability. These insights help assess which purchases likely contributed most to business success.

        <h2>Our Analysis Question</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Which 10 purchase orders generated the highest profit?</strong><br><br>
          To answer this, we estimated profit for each purchase order by assuming that all purchased items were sold at their listed catalog price. 
          <br><br>
          Although this approach may not reflect real-world variations like discounts or unsold stock, it serves as a practical and consistent method to approximate profitability in the absence of detailed sales tracking.
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology Explained</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset does not directly link individual sales to their corresponding purchase orders. As a result, we estimated the revenue and profit for each purchase order based on logical assumptions.
          <br><br>
          Specifically, we assumed that all items purchased were eventually sold at their standard catalog price. Under this approach, <strong>estimated revenue</strong> is calculated as:
          <br>
          <code>Selling Price minus the Quantity Ordered</code>
          <br>
          and <strong>estimated profit</strong> is derived by subtracting the original purchase cost.
          <br><br>
          While this does not account for potential discounts, partial sales, or unsold inventory, it offers a consistent and practical way to identify which purchase orders likely contributed the most to profitability. All values are labeled estimated to reflect this assumption and ensure transparency.

      <h2>What Can You Ask the Chatbot?</h2>
      <p>
        Try asking:
        <ul>
          <li>"What is the most profitable purchase order?"</li>
          <li>"Which vendor had the highest estimated revenue?"</li>
          <li>"Show purchase orders sorted by profit."</li>
        </ul>
        DataBuddy responds based on the uploaded purchase dataset.
